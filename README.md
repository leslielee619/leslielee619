- It has not been updated for a long time, mainly because: 1) it is not convenient to check Github in China; 2) Gitee is a substitute for Github for me; 3) I gradually feel that I need to master more knowledge of mathematical and physics, so I spend less time on programming. Of course, mathematical physics also needs programming.
