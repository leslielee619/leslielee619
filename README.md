- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leslielee619
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machinery, math, physics, computer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ~~PyQt5/PyQt6~~ RotorDynmics, MatrixTheory, FEA. You know that for a eigennering student, you should master applied mechanics and applied mathmatics theory.

- It has not been updated for a long time, mainly because: 1) it is not convenient to check Github in China; 2) Gitee is a substitute for Github for me; 3) I gradually feel that I need to master more knowledge of mathematics and physics, so I spend less time on programming, of course, they also need programming.
- Do you like this? https://leslielee619.github.io/dynamic-photo-album/pc.html I made it last year.
